Welcome to my To-Do-List application!

I hope you enjoy messing around with it as much as I enjoyed creating it :)

How to use:
- On launch, you can type out a new Task and add it to the To Do List by pressing
'enter' or clicking on the "Create Task" button.
- To mark a task as completed, click on the task itself or the check box next to it.
- To remove the completed mark from a task, the same process can be used.
- To delete a task, press on the delete button that appears on the right when hovering
over a task.

Enjoy!!!
