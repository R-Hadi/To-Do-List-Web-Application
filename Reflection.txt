Reflection:

    Building this To-Do List application has been an exciting adventure since it provided me with the
opportunity to refresh my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills while reigniting my creative side. Although
the process was fairly seamless for the most part, I encountered a few problems along the way that tested
my abilities and patience. The main major hiccup I encountered was regarding the hover animation I was 
creating for the list elements. Initially, I spent time attempting to implement an animation that enlarges
the task that the user was hovering on, encouraging them to click it and complete it. This resulted in
many bugs that caused surrounding elements to glitch and move all over the place. After multiple
tries and research, I decided to simplify the hover back to a shadow and color shift until I find time to 
attempt to tackle the problem again. This encounter made me realise that at some points, it is better to 
take a step back and revisit the basics when working on a project so one issue does not hold up the rest,
as long as you always find time to back and reattempt to achieve the plans you had in the first place.
